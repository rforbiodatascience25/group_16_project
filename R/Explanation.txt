In this analysis, we start by aligning the sample identifiers across all tables so that the phenotype rows and expression columns match perfectly, and we create a simple two-group variable that labels each sample as either Normal or Tumor. With this setup, we build a design matrix and run a differential expression analysis using the limma framework, which fits a linear model to every gene and applies empirical Bayes shrinkage to make the variance estimates more stable. The full set of differential expression results (after collapsing multiple probes to a single gene for proper annotation and to avoid duplicates) becomes the gene universe for the network analysis, while the strongest signals—genes with very low FDR values  (adjusted p-values) and large fold changes (difference in expression between the 2 conditions) —are extracted as seed genes.

To build the network, we use Reactome pathway co-membership: genes (dots in the network graph) are connected when they appear together in at least two pathways (biological processes), which creates a graph where edges (links or gray lines) represent shared biological roles. Genes that are more closely related are also located closer to each other.
We then focus on the subnetworks that surround the seed genes and apply Louvain community detection to break the graph into clear modules—clusters of genes that tend to work in related processes. For each module, we compute basic network statistics such as node degree, strength, and betweenness, and we identify hub genes (genes that connect with many others in the cluster), defined as genes with degree in the top 10% of the network.

Next, we interpret these modules biologically using over-representation analysis (ORA) with pathways from Reactome database. For every module, we look at which pathways are statistically enriched (most plausible) and use the most significant pathway out of all candidates to provide a clean, descriptive label for every module. This gives each network module a functional identity. We also highlight “key modules,” defined as those clusters of the graph that show multiple enriched pathways, contain several differentially expressed genes, and have strong statistical support.

Finally, to summarize the strongest transcriptional changes, we extract the top 20 upregulated and top 20 downregulated genes based on their fold change and adjusted p-values. They are also compared to one another and ranked based on their fold change. These genes represent the most strongly altered signals in the Tumor vs Normal comparison and serve as a concise snapshot of the major expression shifts captured by the network.
